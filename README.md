## Data Science Apps

### [Soccer Legues Positions App](https://github.com/Brocoleta/soccer-leagues/tree/main)

I developed an application that updates the tables of the main European and Chilean soccer leagues, developed using principles of Data Engineering, using Apache Airflow and SnowFlake, to make an ETL that updates the information every Monday.

### [Youtube Channels Statistics App](https://github.com/Brocoleta/youtube-statistics)

I developed an application that extracts statistics from different youtube channels at choice every day with ETLs, developed using main AWS services such as S3, Lamda, Athena, EventBridge

### [Messaging Weather Warning App](https://github.com/Brocoleta/forecast-weather)

I developed an application using AWS EC2 that sends an SMS message to the cell phone when the temperature of the day is going to be less than 10 degrees and at what time.

## Research

### [Efficiency of Shilling Attacks in Modern Recommenders](https://github.com/Brocoleta/CV/blob/master/Efficiency%20of%20Shilling%20Attacks%20in%20Modern%20Recommenders.pdf)

In my research, I focused on the issues related to recommender systems and their societal impact, with a particular emphasis on attacks designed to bias their outcomes in favor or against specific items. One prominent attack, known as shilling attack, involves the insertion of fabricated profiles and ratings into the system's database. To assess the effectiveness of various attack strategies on modern recommenders, I aimed to manipulate the system so that my chosen target items would be recommended to a large number of users. For this purpose, I devised an attack that introduces fake users with meticulously crafted ratings into the recommender system. Through extensive experimentation using the Movielens dataset, I discovered that certain attacks proved to be more effective than others, and more intricate recommender systems such as neural networks exhibited greater resistance to such attacks. These findings were primarily based on the HR@10 metric, which gauges the percentage of real users to whom the target item is recommended within the top ùëò selected items.

### [Efficiency of Bagging Ensemble Method on Modern Transformers](https://github.com/Brocoleta/CV/blob/master/Efficiency%20of%20Bagging%20Ensemble%20Method%20on%20Modern%20Transformers.pdf)

During my study, I explored the fascinating concept of "ensemble methods" in machine learning, which aligns with the saying "Two heads are better than one." The idea is to combine multiple models to create a more powerful one, based on the hypothesis that their collaboration yields superior results. Moreover, I delved into the transformative impact of innovative transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks that process inputs sequentially, transformers process all inputs simultaneously, enabling greater parallelization, faster training times, and improved outcomes in NLP tasks. In this research, I aimed to merge these two ideas, ensemble models, and transformers. I began by analyzing different transformers with various datasets to select the most suitable transformer for the ensemble. Subsequently, I examined how this chosen transformer performed within different ensemble architectures. Surprisingly, the results deviated from expectations, leading to the conclusion that, due to their inherent complexity, transformers tend to excel when used individually rather than in combination.
